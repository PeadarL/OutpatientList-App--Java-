# OutpatientList-App--Java-

The application is designed to receive outpatient information from hospital staff, which is then stored in a database and presented
in a table according to patient condition severity.Once stored within the database, the user can view the patientâ€™s summary
or remove the selected patient from the waiting list. Sorting of outpatients is achieved using a Double Linked List.
